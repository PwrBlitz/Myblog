        <h1>Hi Everyone!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Hi, my name is Vedd and my hobby is gaming. This hobby started when 4 or 5 years ago my uncle had a Nintendo Wii which he was not using anymore. He asked if we wanted it and my dad was like yeah sure Vedd can get exercise not outside but even inside. Once we got the Wii I wanted to play more of the games like Lego Batman or Cars. then 1 and a half years later, the Xbox One S and X came out and my dad didn't want me to have the Xbox One S but since everyone had it he was like okkk I will let him have it, and till this day I have had the xbox and I play video games as my hobby!</p>
